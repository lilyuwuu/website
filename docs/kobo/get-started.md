# Get Started

If you don't know what to do with your Kobo in terms of modifications, there are three main paths that you can follow. **These paths are not mutually exclusive -- you can follow all of them at any point if there are modifications from all three that you'd like to make**. In all cases, should something go catastrophically wrong, your issue will likely be fixable with a manual factory reset.

!!! info "Info"
	The default system reading application is often referred to as "Nickel".

!!! warning "Windows users: You should enable hidden files"
	Kobo's directories start with a period in the front, which mean that your operating system might hide them from you by default.

!!! warning "macOS users: You should disable automatic extraction"
	Safari automatically extracts ZIP files by default, which may not always be desirable (especially when using the one-click packages). You can disable this feature by following [these instructions](https://wiki.umbc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=31919091).

# <center>[Custom Software](/kobo/guide/custom-software)</center>

Custom software, for the most part, does not *replace* Nickel -- it runs alongside it as something that you can launch after boot. Think of it like how you install another application on a computer or a phone. The goal here is not to modify Nickel -- the goal is to install software that will allow you to run software other than Nickel.

The instructions given here will use the [one-click install packages](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=314220) to install the following:

- [NickelMenu](https://pgaskin.net/NickelMenu/), a customizable set of menus that can be used to launch applications from your home menu, as well as to add menu options to your reading experience
- [Kute File Monitor (KFMon)](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=274231), a launcher that uses images to launch applications
- Either or both [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/) and [Plato](https://github.com/baskerville/plato/), alternate reading applications with additional quality-of-life features that may not be found in Nickel

# <center>[Nickel Modifications](/kobo/guide/kobopatch)</center>

Nickel modifications refer to changes made to Nickel to change your reading experience. While [NickelMenu]((https://pgaskin.net/NickelMenu/)) is a form of one, the changes referred to here will be done through a tool called KoboPatch. The tool will be used to make a modified Nickel that will be installed to your device, featuring all Nickel features plus whatever modifications you've decided to make.

The instructions given here will use the [kobopatch forum thread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=297338) to install patches of your choosing.

# <center>[Nickel's Hidden Features](/kobo/guide/nickel-options)</center>

These refer to changes or additions that can be made simply by creating files/folders or by modifying your `Kobo eReader.conf` file. These are things that are built into every Kobo by its developers.

The instructions given here will not be linear -- they'll be more of a list of things that you can do.
