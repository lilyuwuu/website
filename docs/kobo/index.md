This section of the site is dedicated to running custom software on e-ink Kobos.

!!! danger "Outdated!!!"
	I haven't updated this part of the site in a while, so information here may be outdated or incorrect. I'm keeping it up for now as I figure out what I want to do with it, but I would heed with caution and check places like [MobileRead](https://mobileread.com) for more up-to-date information.

!!! danger "Disclaimer"
	While Kobo hasn't previously and currently doesn't make any attempts to block device modifications, **modifying your device still voids your warranty**. While the majority of bricks can be fixed with a hardware factory reset, the possibility of damaging your device still exists. I'm not responsible should anything bad occur.

!!! info "E-ink Kobos only"
	This website is intended for e-ink Kobos (with black and white screens). If you have a colour Kobo tablet or want to do something with the Kobo app, this site is not for you.

One of the neat things about Kobo is the fact that you're freely able to modify aspects of your own device, with Kobo (as of 2021) not putting any roadblocks to achieving that goal. Given the number of posts regarding Kobo modifications, I've decided to make a website to try to help guide people towards unlocking the full capabilities of their devices.

For the most part, this page will assume that you have a **touchscreen Kobo** on the **latest firmware** (at present, **4.30.18838**). If you have an unsupported device (the Kobo Mini or the original non-touchscreen Kobos) or an old firmware (<4.0), methods may still exist to modify your device, but this website may not cover them in depth.

This website largely consists of things that I've done on my own devices (a Libra H2O, a Glo, and in a past life, a Mini and a Glo HD). I don't know everything about modifying Kobo devices, so if you have anything you'd like to contribute or clarify, feel free to contact me or to [submit a pull request / issue](https://github.com/lilyuwuu/website).

!!! warning "About devices with non-removable internal memory" 
	Certain Kobo devices have non-removable internal memory. This means that messing with critcal system files could result in a fully bricked device with no recovery route. You will be warned beforehand if the given instructions are considered dangerous for these devices.
