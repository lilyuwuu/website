# Developer Stuff

!!! danger "Some risky stuff here"
	Use any of these tools at your own risk. Be careful, especially if your Kobo's internal memory is soldered.
	
Unfortunately, I'm not a developer, so I have no idea how much of the developer stuff works on a Kobo. However, for those that are interested, check out:
