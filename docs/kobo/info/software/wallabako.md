**Wallabako** is a Wallabag client for Kobo (kind of like Pocket, but more open-source). While a similar functionality exists in KOReader, this application is built specifically for the purpose of retrieving articles from Wallabag.

Installation instructions are available [here](https://gitlab.com/anarcat/wallabako).
