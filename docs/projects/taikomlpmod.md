!!! warning "Save data warning"
	Since this mod **replaces** base songs with custom ones, getting a greater score than legitimately possible will result in that score staying forever, even if the LayeredFS mod is removed. **Therefore, it is highly recommended to back up your save data with Checkpoint or JKSM before installing this mod.**
