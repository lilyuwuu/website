# Part 8: Testing

!!! abstract "TL;DR"

    - Please, please, please test your song before you publish it.
    - Testing is the easiest way to catch silly mistakes that you did not catch earlier, such as an obviously incorrect pitch or a lyric that looks wrong.
    - You should test on **Medium difficulty**, because Easy's pitch recognition is too lenient and can mislead you on whether your pitches are correct.
    - You should get a score that is about as good as you would on a well-made chart. For example, I regularly get 9500+ when playing on Medium, so that is my target on my own songs.

## Overview

Congratulations! You've finally finished charting a song. Seriously, that's a big accomplishment and I hope that it is only the start of more songs to come. More people making karaoke is always a good thing.

All that remains is to **test** the song. You may wonder why this is necessary, considering how many assurance measures have been done in the previous steps. Here are the main reasons why:

- People can make silly mistakes, especially if they chart something quickly. A pitch can be obviously incorrect, or a lyric can display in an unintended way. It happens.
- It helps you verify that your song works in the real world. Up until now, we've been doing all of our work in editors, and while we may *theoretically* end up with a good chart, we won't know for sure until we test it.

### Testing difficulty and goal

The difficulty and goal largely depends on your personal skill in comepttiive karaoke games. I generally recommend that people test on **Medium**. This is because:

- **Easy** is generally too lenient with pitch recognition. If you have incorrect pitches and you test on Easy, then you might not even know it because the game will just mark your singing as correct.
- **Hard**, by contrast, is a bit too strict (at least for most people). Personally, my scores on Hard tend to fluctuate between 7000 and 9000 on a really good chart, so it's hard to tell if a low score is because of a currently present skill issue or because the song is mechanically difficult.

Your target score should be whatever score you can normally get on Medium. This might not mean much until around the 7500+ mark, but the idea is: if you're getting similar scores on your chart to the ones that you get on known well-made charts, then your chart is probably pretty good. (Of course, if you're unable to get decent scores on well-made charts *and* on your own chart, that would suggest a skill ceiling that you have yet to break, or a calibration issue on your end. Regardless, you can always ask someone to test the song for you before you release it more widely.)

So, without further ado, let's test!

...

Oh, uh, you'll need your microphone for this.

I think the result is pretty clear:

!!! success

     

## Next steps

Now that you're done testing your song, you're ready to upload it somewhere! But where?
