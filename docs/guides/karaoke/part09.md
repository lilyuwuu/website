# Part 9: Submission

!!! abstract "TL;DR"

    - You should probably submit your song to [USDB](https://usdb.animux.de/).
    - If it's a My Little Pony-related song, you can should submit it to [My Little Karaoke](https://www.mylittlekaraoke.com/forum/) ([Discord](https://discord.gg/UsGcpnv)) instead of USDB.
    - Only upload the TXT!!! If you got the audio from YouTube (or anywhere else), a link to that audio may be helpful, but you should NOT provide the audio yourself! That would be copyright infringement!

## Overview

You've finally finished and tested your song! You should share it with the masses so that others can enjoy your fine work.

The main place to upload TXT files is [USDB](https://usdb.animux.de/). Once logged in, click "Add songs" then "Browse..." to select the song's **TXT** file, then Submit. Once it goes through moderation, it will be available for anyone else to download!

!!! warning "About audio sources"

    As said at the beginning of the guide, you **cannot** distribute audio without permission because it is a violation of copyright law. If you have timed your TXT to a specific audio file (whether that be a CD rip or a specific video on YouTube), you should indicate it in your submission. This will save time for the moderators and will ensure that your song is actually playable without needing to change the GAP.

### If your song is related to My Little Pony

I'm always happy to see more people charting pony songs /)

You can submit songs to My Little Karaoke on the [forum](https://www.mylittlekaraoke.com/forum/) (in one of the WIP boards), and/or on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/UsGcpnv) (just post a Google Drive link or whatever in the general chat, someone will see it). If you're planning to make even more songs, welcome aboard! You might want to ask in the Discord for access to the shared work drive once you've made a few more.


## Afterword

I hope this tutorial was helpful in some way. If you have any comments about it, or would like clarification on one of the points within, you can always ask me about it. I can be most often reached on Discord (`@horse.horsehorsehorsehorse.horse` or `@lilyshy`), but I also have an e-mail if you prefer that (lily at `<this domain>`). I don't check my e-mail all that often though.

If you have general questions about charting, whether that be about installing the programs you need or the actual mechanics of charting or pitching, I can always recommend the wonderful folks over at the [UltraStar Vocaluxe & Performus Community](https://discord.gg/tNEXZw2QJX) (Discord).

Best of luck with any future charts you may make!

Start your next song!

Or take a break, you've earned it :)
