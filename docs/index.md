## About

Hi, I'm lily. I like to do things on the Internet. Here are some of the things I dabble in...

### 3DS modding

I've dabbled in the lands of DS/3DS homebrew for quite a while (having owned a DS flashcart since the late 2000s, a Sky3DS in 2015 and having dabbled with tubehax and menuhax in 2015-2016), but I would generally say I've been more directly involved in the 3DS homebrew/modding scene since around early 2017 (almost seven years!), around the tail end of arm9loaderhax-based installations (it was quite complicated back then!). 

I've always been inclined towards helping people, so it was around 2017 when I started helping people with 3DS-related issues for most of that time over at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh) - something I continue to do to this day. (I also hang around [GBATemp](https://gbatemp.net/forums/nintendo-3ds.199/) and Reddit sometimes.)

I've been helping maintain [3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) since around late 2020, a few months after [Plailect](https://github.com/plailect) transferred hacks.guide to [ihaveahax](https://ihaveahax.net/). If you've used the guide (or even followed a YouTube guide!) to mod your 3DS in the past three years, chances are you've been following instructions I've written or contributed to! I hope you've had as much fun modding your console(s) as I've had in making documentation that's hopefully [surprisingly easy](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2436665) to follow. :)

### Documentation and guide-writing

As you can probably tell from this site, I like to write guides and documentation in my spare time, with the goal of making traditionally difficult topics easy enough for anyone to follow. Most of my guides are concentrated here (in wonderful, wonderful Markdown), but I've also written (or contributed to) English-language documentation about the rhythm games [Ongeki](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HKCW7DWjYRnVjCmPzrQwDKC0wKTi41X-Y-dP1-ygliU/edit?usp=sharing) and [Groove Coaster (outdated)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W7LavJKqfvauztVIdbxeII_HtA1Z9XJ5U13g-I-DgJs/edit?usp=sharing).

### E-readers / e-ink

I like reading books on e-readers! Well, fanfiction, mostly. I'm particularly a fan of the [Rakuten Kobo](https://kobo.com) line of e-readers as they are completely free of restrictions, allowing me to run my personal favourite reading application, [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/).

Naturally, I've written some documentation on surface-level tinkering with Kobos over [here](kobo), but it's gotten a bit outdated, so I would heed caution in following anything I wrote there.

### Rhythm games

I like to play rhythm games, usually at the arcade! My personal favourites are [Ongeki](https://ongeki.sega.jp/), [Groove Coaster](https://groovecoaster.jp), [Chunithm](https://chunithm.sega.jp), and [Tetote Connect](https://tetoteconnect.jp), but I also dabble with [Taiko no Tatsujin](https://taiko.namco-ch.net/taiko/), SDVX, and IIDX. 

I'll probably put some scores up on this website at some point, but for now, here's my [Ongeki Score Log](https://ongeki-score.net/user/7257/) profile. It'll stay roughly the same since it only gets updated if I go to Japan, though.

### Animated horse show

It might not be super obvious from my profile... or this website..., but I do generally consider myself to be a fan of the [animated horse cartoon](https://www.equestriadaily.com/). In particular, I read a lot of fanfiction ([here](https://www.fimfiction.net/bookshelf/1244885/favourites) are my personal favourites) and listen to a lot of music (current favourites, subject to rotation, not necessarily still in pony fandom: [4everfreebrony](https://www.youtube.com/@4everfreebrony), [Koa](https://twitter.com/KoaPony), [Metajoker](https://www.youtube.com/@Metajoker), [CadetRedShirt](https://www.youtube.com/@CadetRedShirt), [Crusader!](https://www.youtube.com/@BandoTheBear), [Flittzy](https://www.youtube.com/@FlittzyMusic), [Forest Rain](https://www.youtube.com/@ForestRainMedia), [John Kenza](https://www.youtube.com/@RyleoGoldridge), [Vylet Pony](https://www.vyletpony.com/)).

Seriously, go check out some pony fandom music! The compilation group [Ponies@Dawn](https://poniesatdawn.bandcamp.com/) puts out a good 60-70 songs every few months in a variety of genres. It's also worth checking out [Luck Rock's monthly compilation list of fandom music](https://www.youtube.com/@LuckRockMusic/playlists) and the [Horse Music Herald](https://horsemusicherald.com/). You're bound to find something in a genre you like (with between a minimal amount and a bunch of pony references thrown in).

## Contact me

If you need something from me (or just want to chat), feel free to contact me! You can reach me **@lilyshy on Discord** (my friend requests should be open, but if you need a mutual server, try [Nintendo Homebrew](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh)).

Discord's the best way to contact me, but you can also contact me by e-mail (**lily at this domain**). I don't check it very often, though.
